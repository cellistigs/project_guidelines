# Personal guidelines for software and project organization. 
Collected Project Organization Guidelines (Specifically for Python Projects on Github)

This repository is an implementation of the development practices that I have learned while working on the NeuroCAAS project. It has several purposes: the first is to document those practices and tools that I have learned so that I don't forget them even as I work on smaller or less structured projects- the second is to provide a template that can ease some of the startup cost of redoing these things from scratch every time I start something new.
