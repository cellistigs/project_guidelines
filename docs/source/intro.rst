Introduction
============

``project_guidelines`` is a toy package that demonstrates some software practices as implemented in a github repository.  

It is mostly for my own consolidation of lessons I have learned in the process of working on the NeuroCAAS project, and will be a testbed for the ideas I have regarding the organization of scientific code. 

Goals
*****

In particular, I would like to cover the fundamentals of how to use github effectively for version control, how to write tests, how to write documentation, how to work with continuous integration practices, how to package and organize code, and general philosophies for how to write code that can faciliate scientific use. As I continue exploring different ideas, I hope to add to this repository as an evolving guide and template for my project organization ideas. 

Specifics
*********

The actual code that we wrote for this package is very simple as of 7/11/20. It consists of a  arithmetic module that implements simple arithmetic operations such as :method:`project_guidelies.utils.arithmetic.add` :method:`project_guidelies.utils.arithmetic.subtract`
